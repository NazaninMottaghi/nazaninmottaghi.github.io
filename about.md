## About Me

Hi, I’m Nazanin, a Postdoctoral Researcher in Digital Finance with a strong background in Mathematics, Blockchain, DeFi, and Real Estate Tokenization at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
With a Ph.D. in Mathematics and several years of postdoctoral experience, I bridge advanced quantitative methods with innovative financial technologies, focusing on how decentralized finance (DeFi), blockchain, and tokenization are transforming traditional markets, particularly in the real estate sector. I believe in leveraging technology to create more accessible, transparent, and sustainable financial ecosystems.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated with startups, contributed to cutting-edge research, and presented at international conferences. 

Beyond research, I am passionate about teaching, mentoring, and promoting inclusive education. 

When I’m not diving into data or blockchain protocols, you’ll find me enjoying nature walks in Stockholm, practicing languages, or caring for my plants.

Feel free to explore my projects, publications, and insights into the future of finance and technology!
